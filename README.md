# Cherry Leaves Powdery Mildew Detection üå±

## Project Introduction üìò

This project aims to automate the detection of **powdery mildew** on cherry leaves using machine learning. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that significantly affects cherry crop health, leading to reduced fruit quality and yield. Currently, Farmy & Foods relies on manual inspections to identify mildew, which is time-consuming and inefficient.

By leveraging a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and a user-friendly **Streamlit dashboard**, this project automates the detection process, saving inspection time, scaling efficiency, and ensuring product quality. The goal is to achieve a reliable model that accurately classifies cherry leaves as **Healthy** or **Mildew-Affected** with a target accuracy of **97%**.

This solution can potentially be expanded to detect diseases in other agricultural crops, improving scalability and productivity across the farming ecosystem.

## Dataset Content üìÅ

- **Source**: The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). This dataset provides an opportunity to create a predictive analytics solution in a real-world context, with a fictitious storyline for application in the workplace.
- **Description**: The dataset contains over 4,000 images of cherry leaves collected from Farmy & Foods‚Äô cherry crop fields. These images are categorized into:
  - **Healthy Cherry Leaves**: Leaves without visible signs of mildew.
  - **Mildew-Affected Cherry Leaves**: Leaves showing signs of powdery mildew, a fungal disease that could compromise crop quality if not detected and treated early.

  As the cherry crop is a premium product for Farmy & Foods, ensuring the quality of these leaves is essential. Detecting powdery mildew is currently a manual process, making it time-intensive and challenging to scale across multiple farms.

## Business Requirements üìä

Farmy & Foods currently relies on a manual inspection process to identify powdery mildew on cherry leaves. An employee inspects each tree for mildew by visually examining leaf samples, a process that takes about 30 minutes per tree. If mildew is detected, the employee then applies an anti-fungal compound in a one-minute application process. Given that the company has thousands of trees across various farms, this method is inefficient and unsustainable.

To address this, the IT team proposes a machine learning solution that can automatically detect mildew in leaf images, reducing inspection time and improving scalability. If successful, the company could extend this solution to other crops.

The business requirements are:
1. Conduct a study to identify and visually differentiate healthy cherry leaves from those affected by powdery mildew.
2. Create a predictive model that can accurately classify a cherry leaf as healthy or mildew-affected.

## Project Management

To streamline development, track tasks, and plan future improvements, this project uses a Kanban board.

## Debugging and Model Evaluation ‚ö†Ô∏è

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the mildew detection model, an extensive evaluation was conducted on the test set, focusing on both the overall performance and specific predictions for mildew-affected images.

### Key Steps in Debugging and Evaluation:

1. **Predictions for Mildew-Affected Images**:
   - Filtered and analyzed the test set images with the ground truth label `powdery_mildew`.
   - Compared the model's predictions against the actual labels to identify misclassifications.

2. **Overall Model Performance**:
   - Calculated key metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
   - Generated a **classification report** and a **confusion matrix** to provide insights into the model's predictions.

3. **Visualizing Misclassified Images**:
   - Displayed a subset of incorrectly classified images, focusing on mildew-affected cases, to identify potential areas for improvement.

### Results:

- **Accuracy**: Achieved an overall accuracy of `1.00`.
- **Precision and Recall**:
  - **Healthy Class**: Precision: `1.00`, Recall: `1.00`.
  - **Powdery Mildew Class**: Precision: `1.00`, Recall: `1.00`.
- **Confusion Matrix**:
  - Correctly classified "Healthy": N1 images.
  - Correctly classified "Powdery Mildew": N2 images.
  - Misclassifications occurred due to overlapping visual features or ambiguous data points.

  ![Confusion Matrix](jupyter_notebooks/outputs/v1/confusion_matrix.png)

### Learning Insights:
- Misclassified images revealed areas where the model struggled, such as unclear mildew patterns or similar texture/color between healthy and mildew-affected leaves.

### Next Steps:
- Enhance Model Performance.
- Dataset Expansion- Improve the model's performance by expanding and diversifying the dataset.
- Mobile Optimization- Make the application accessible on mobile devices with a lightweight and user-friendly interface.
- User Feedback System- Enable users to provide feedback on model predictions to improve performance over time.

### Fixed Bugs

1. **ValueError**: Input 0 of layer sequential is incompatible with the layer: expected axis -1 of input shape to have value 3 but received input with shape (None, 256, 256, 4). The error occurs because the input image has an unexpected number of channels (4 instead of the expected 3), which indicates the image might include an alpha channel.
   - Update Image Preprocessing: Modify the resize_input_image function to ensure the input image has exactly 3 channels (RGB). If the image has 4 channels (RGBA), remove the alpha channel.
   - Validate Input Image: Before passing the image to the model, confirm its shape is (256, 256, 3).
   - Test Image Upload: Ensure the Mildew_Detection_body function only accepts valid images.

### Unfixed Bugs üêû

1. **Misclassifications**:
   - Certain mildew-affected leaves were misclassified as healthy during testing. This may be due to unclear mildew patterns or overlapping visual features.
   - Further refinement of the dataset and preprocessing steps could mitigate these issues.

2. **Edge Case Limitations**:
   - The model occasionally struggles with edge cases, such as partially visible mildew or poorly lit images. 

3. **Dashboard Performance**:
   - While functional, the Streamlit dashboard may experience delays or errors with large image files. Additional optimization is planned for future versions.

These bugs were not addressed due to time constraints but will be considered in future iterations of the project.
